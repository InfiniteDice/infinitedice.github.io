<b>Can you summarize all the preference options?</b><p>
	When you select Preferences from the Option menu, a dialog box
appears with
controls for many operational facets of Netscape. A pop-menu in
the
dialog box lets you select one of the following sets of preference
controls:<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Styles</b>
<br>
<b>Window</b> options let you designate a home page
and specify
the style of toolbar buttons and content area fonts. <b>Link</b>
options let
you choose the underlining, color, and color longevity of highlighted
text
links.

<li><b>Network and Images</b> (<b>Images, Networks, and Mail </b>on the
Macintosh)
<br>
<b>Images</b> options let you determine a priority
for loading
images and, depending on the platform, the manner that colors are
approximated.
<b>Connections</b> options, depending on the platform, let you specify
the size
of a memory cache, the size of a network buffer, and the maximum number
of
network connections.

<li><b>Directories, Applications, and News</b>
<br>
<b>Directories</b> options let you designate the
Temporary
directory used to hold files that require helper applications. Before a
helper
application launches a file, Netscape saves the file to disk in the
Temporary
directory. <b>Applications</b> options let you specify the location of
these
supporting applications: Telnet, HTML Source Viewer, and TN3270.
<b>News</b>
options let you specify the host name for the news server (that
supplies UseNet
newsgroups), a news RC file, and the manner that news descriptions are
displayed

<li><b>Mail and Proxies</b> (<b>Proxies</b> on the Macintosh)
<br>
<b>Mail</b> options require that you specify a mail server,
your user
name, and your e-mail address in order to have a viable incoming mail
address
(allowing others to respond to Netscape mail you send). <b>Proxies</b>
options let
you designate proxies and ports for FTP, HTTP, Gopher, News, and WAIS
protocols, and depending on the platform, a SOCKS host.

<li><b>Helper Applications</b>
<br>
<b>Helper Applications</b> options let you map Mime types
and extensions
of external applications, and depending on the platform, actions to
take.
</ul>

<b>What does each part of an Internet address such as
"yourname@aserver.bserver.org" mean?</b><p>
	The first part, <b>yourName</b>, identifies a user. The <b>@</b>
symbol
(pronounced "at") separates the user name from the location of the mail
server.
The last part, <b>aserver.bserver.org</b>, identifies the location of
the mail
server. Addresses use lowercase letters without any spaces.
<p>
The name of a location contains at least a string and, typically, a
three-letter suffix, set apart by a dot (the period symbol is
pronounced
"dot"). The name of a location might require several subparts to
identify the
server (a host name and zero or more subdomains), each separated by
dots . The
three-letter suffix in the location name helps identify the kind of
organization operating the server. (Some locations use a two-letter
geographical suffix.) Here are the common suffixes and organizational
affiliation:
<blockquote>
	<b>.com</b> (commercial) <br>
	<b>.edu</b> (educational) <br>
	<b>.gov</b> (government) <br>
	<b>.mil</b> (military) <br>
	<b>.net</b> (networking) <br>
	<b>.org</b> (noncommercial)</blockquote>

<b>What do I need to know about helper applications and MIME
types?</b><p>
	To examine or modify the mapping of file formats (MIME types) to
helper
applications:<p>

<ol>
<li>	Choose <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
<li>	Choose the <b>Helper Applications</b> submenu item from
the pop-up menu
in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.</ol><p>
HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol) servers use HTML formatting. Netscape
software has the built-in capability to read HTML formatted pages (as
well as
some common graphic file formats such as <b>gif</b> and <b>jpeg</b>).
Other
protocols use formats that Netscape can interpret only with the help of
external
helper applications. In order for Netscape to accommodate the file
formats
requiring helper applications, Netscape keeps a mapping of file formats
to helper
applications.
<p>
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standardized method
for
organizing divergent file formats. The method organizes file formats
according
to the file's MIME type. When Netscape software retrieves a file from a
server,
the server provides the MIME type of the file. Netscape uses the MIME
type to
establish whether the file format can be read by the software's
built-in
capabilities or, if not, whether a suitable helper application is
available to
read the file.
<p>
For servers that do not provide a MIME type with a file, Netscape
interprets the
file's extension (a suffix appended to a file name). For example, the
<b>.html</b> extension in the file name <b>Mosaic.html</b>
suggests a file
in the HTML format. Likewise, a <b>.zip</b> extension suggests a file
compressed with the Zipper application, an <b>.rtf</b> extension
suggests a
file in the Rich Text Format, and so on. You can view and configure the
mapping
of all MIME types to helper applications by choosing the <b>Helper
Applications</b> submenu item within the <b>Preference</b> dialog
box.
