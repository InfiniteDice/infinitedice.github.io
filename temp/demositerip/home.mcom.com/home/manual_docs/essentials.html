You're going to use Netscape software to bring pages of the Internet to
your computer screen. With a few essentials you can begin exploring
long before you finish reading this handbook. A separate booklet called
<b>Netscape Setup</b> gives you platform-specific instructions for
configuring your
hardware, software, and network connections. This handbook assumes you
have a
computer system capable of running the Netscape application.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="essentials.html#RTFToC0">Essentials</a>
<dd>contains
information to
give you a quick start with the Netscape software. 
<dt><a href="intro.html#RTFToC0">Heartwarming
introduction</a> 
<dd>is like nothing
you've ever read in a product manual. It's conversations with my
family, the Kafka family. Those of you new to Netscape and the Internet
might find
you'll
acquire what you most need to know in the least daunting of manners.
<dt><a href="learn.html#RTFToC0">Learn Netscape</a>
<dd>presents the prominent topics of
Netscape operation in short, tutorial style. Some topics may
interest you immediately; others you may want to consult only after
you've used
the software and desire more instruction.
<dt><a href="graphics.html#RTFToC0">Graphical
elements</a> 
<dd>is a
general reference to the
Netscape application organized by what you see on the screen. You can
ascertain 
basic operations without being distracted by a preponderance of
details.
<dt><a href="menus.html#RTFToC0">Menu items</a> 
<dd>is a specific
reference to each feature
of the Netscape application obtained through the menu bar. One by one,
you'll find each menu selection explained, and in doing so, you'll
methodically uncover virtually every feature the application offers.
<dt><a href="answers.html#RTFToC0">Answers to tough
questions</a> 
<dd>delivers the
information most Internet users ultimately want to know. Here, the
topics range from "tips and tricks" to "customizations" to "what on the
good earth is this for?"

<p>
With all due respect to the encyclopedic tomes and well-intentioned
(drop-dead dull) glossaries that try to wordsmith away the complexities
of the Internet, every effort has been made to keep this handbook thin
and
useful with eye-opening, foot-stomping logic. It seems only appropriate
that

Netscape, the Internet's breakthrough application, present you with a
break: a manual for you, for my Ma and Pa, my sister, brother,
daughter, son, and significant someone. <b>Netscape Handbook</b> is yours.<p>

Some of you are reading this handbook on printed paper; others are
reading online using Netscape software (and no, no thought was given to
calling the online version an eyebook). If you are reading this
cover-to-cover
for the first time, you might prefer the familiarity and portability of
paper. Later, when you want to look-up a particular feature while
sitting at
your computer, you're likely to more rapidly pinpoint the text you need
by
clicking your mouse on online pages.
<p>
If you are reading online, you've already accomplished the most
challenging aspect of the Internet: connecting. Netscape software makes
everything else a veritable breeze (that is, a piece of cake, a walk in
the woods, a can
of
corn).
<p>
For those who need help getting online, read the <b>Netscape Setup</b>
booklet for:
<ul>
<li>	Computer hardware, software, and network connection
requirements 
<li>	Floppy disk or network download installation instructions
for the Netscape application and related software
<li>	Latest version information for the Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX
platforms
<li>	Sales and technical support access</ul><p>
In this handbook you'll see how Netscape brings you more of the Internet
with
less of the complexity. The cryptic acronyms and jargon haven't been
banished
entirely, yet you can go a long way toward enjoying the features of:
<ul>
<li>	Richly formatted, multimedia pages (without studying HTTP)
<li>	External graphics (without mastering GIF and JPEG)
<li>	Full-fledged newsgroup interaction (without worries of
NNTP)
<li>	Simple mail delivery (without dwelling on SMTP)
<li>	Shareware and public domain software libraries (without
the intricacies of FTP)
<li>	Internet application access (without nightmares of
UNIX)</ul>

Each Netscape page gives you opportunities to point and click your way to

other pages of information on the Internet.
<ul>
<li>	Highlighted words and images in the content area of a page are
links
that bring new pages to your screen when clicked on.
<li>	Toolbar buttons activate the Netscape features you'll most
commonly use.
<li>	Directory buttons link to pages with information and tools for 
browsing the Internet.
<li>	Pull-down menu items activate the same features as toolbar
buttons plus additional features you'll use less frequently.
<li>	The <b>Location:</b> /<b>Go to:</b> text field shows you
the location (URL) of the current page and can be used to enter the
location (the URL address) of the page you wish to go to next.
<li>	The status indicator animates to show when a transfer is
in progress.
<li>	The status message field shows you information about a targeted

page or a transfer in progress. For example, when you point the cursor 
over a highlighted link, the status field displays the location (URL)
of 
the targeted page (the page a mouse click brings).
<li>	The progress bar fills with color as a transfer operation
completes its progress.
<li>	The title bar shows the name, if any, of the current
page.</ul><p>

This handbook demonstrates many of the navigational and customization
tools provided by Netscape software to make your exploration of the
Internet productive and efficient. Here are some examples of what you
can do:
<ul>
<li>	Show or hide graphic elements (button bars, text fields, and 
indicators) to suit your preferences.
<li>	Create bookmarks listing your favorite pages.
<li>	Show travel histories of what you have seen.
<li>	Share pages you have discovered with others.
<li>	Use searching and address tools to find new links to new pages.
<li>	Designate your own home page.</ul>

The home page is a file that can serve as your starting point for
bringing 
all other pages to your screen. You can start bringing pages of the
network 
to you by clicking on any highlighted words (colored and/or underlined)
or 
highlighted graphics (images with colored borders) in the content area
of a 
page. Highlighted words and graphics are links to other Internet pages.

Many of the buttons in the button bars and items in the menu bar are
also 
links to Internet pages. For example, pressing the <b>Back</b> button
in the 
toolbar or choosing the <b>Back</b> menu item from the <b>Go</b> menu
links you to (brings) the previous page.
<p>
Try moving back and forth between two pages:
<ol>
<li>	Click on any highlighted words to bring a new page to your
screen

(but read step 2 before you do so).
<li>	Click on the toolbar's <b>Back</b> button (its picture is a
left

arrow) or select <b>Back</b> from the <b>Go</b> menu to bring back the 
previous page containing the original link you clicked on.
<li>	Repeat steps 1 and 2 and notice changes in the
<b>Location:</b> field (showing the network location of the page on
screen), the Netscape
symbol status indicator (animated when a transfer is in progress), the
status message field at the bottom left of the screen (showing the
network location of a page you can bring or the completion status of a 
transfer), and the progress bar at the bottom right of the screen 
(illustrating the progress of a transfer).
</ul>
