You're going to bring pages of the Internet to your computer screen.
The Internet is a collection of information stored in computers
physically
located throughout the world. Much of the information on the Internet
is
organized onto pages. You'll bring one page to your computer screen,
discover its
contents, and have the option of bringing more pages of
information. 
<p>
Some pages on the Internet are cool. I mean really cool. They can be
richly formatted and colorfully illustrated, capable of bringing you
sounds
and movies and interactivity. Other pages can be as ugly and
disagreeable as what
you'd find under a rock. Your goal: to bring yourself gratifying pages
of
information, and no others. 
<p>
Content is everything. But to get to the content you seek, you'll need
connections to those pages. Well-crafted pages provide built-in
connections to other pages. That is, clicking your mouse button on a
highlighted
word or picture brings another page of information--a linked page--to
your
screen. The
entire network of pages can be potentially interlinked, one pointing to
another. As a result, you can bring information in the meaningful
context of "Here
is some information on a page in front of me, and highlighted on this
page is a
connection to related information I might wish to explore next." 
<p>
Netscape's popularity stems from the opulence of its pages and the ease 
of bringing them to your screen. Pages designed with expressive
lettering, 
art, color, photos, sound, animation, forms, and interactivity can be 
linked to an untold number of similar pages distributed on networked 
computers worldwide.
Netscape explores World Wide Web pages, a part of the Internet rich in
multimedia features, as well as other parts of the Internet that are
often
text-based. The Internet's Usenet newsgroups, electronic mail, and
alternative
transport protocols offer impressive diversity of content and
communicative
prowess. To take advantage of this wealth, Netscape software contains
features to
explore the Internet in numerous domains. 
<p>
Foremost, Netscape software presents pages of the Internet with elegance
and efficiency. Netscape software is a browser--an interface--to pages
throughout the world. Netscape software allows you to immerse yourself in
content
unencumbered by the complexity of distributed networks.

Now, you're probably comfortable with the idea that information on the
Internet is presented on pages you see on the screen. Even the
navigational
concepts are pretty easy:
<ul>
<li>	You start with a home page.
<li>	You click on highlighted words (colored and/or underlined)
in a page to
bring another page of related information to your screen.
<li>	You click on arrow buttons to go back (or forward) to a
page you have previously seen.</ul><p>
Plus, you can go directly to pages that interest you by choosing menu
items:
<ul>
<li>	History items in the <b>Go</b> menu bring pages you have viewed
before.
<li>	Bookmarks items in the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu bring pages
you have
designated as worthy of easy access.
<li>	Directory items in the <b>Directory</b> menu bring pages
that help you use Netscape and Internet features</ul><p>
Ideally, the act of finding pages becomes secondary to what you really
care about: the page's content. 
<p>
Like pages of a magazine, you'll want to flip from one screen page to
another, sometimes to continue with the same article and other times to
begin a
new article. But you can't hold screen pages in your hands like you can

a magazine. Screen pages are rarely uniform in length and, displayed
one 
page at a time, don't provide intuitive feedback on where the
information 
begins and ends.
<p>
So even though Internet pages bring information to you rather
gloriously, there is something distinctly uncomfortable about content
which may continue
over numerous links to pages of varying lengths. Anyone who has
witnessed a
slide show of a neighbor's family vacation can identify with the queasy
sensation of boundlessness. 
<p>
Readers of electronic pages need tools to keep track of pages. The
Netscape text fields, toolbar buttons, and menu items seek to provide you
with the
ability to manage pages of information that might otherwise leave you
feeling
overwhelmed and unfocused.<p>

<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%>
<A NAME="RTFToC3">
<FONT SIZE=+3>K</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>nowing that every page has a unique
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=+3>URL</FONT>
</A>
<P>

To understand how a single page is kept distinct in a world of
electronic pages, you ought to recognize its URL, short for Uniform
Resource
Locator. Every page has a unique URL just like every person has a
unique palm
print. (Arguments persist as to which is more cryptic.) 
<p>
A URL is text used for identifying and addressing an item in a computer
network. In short, a URL provides location information and Netscape
displays a URL in the <b>Location</b> field. Most often you don't need
to know a
page's URL because the location information is built into a highlighted
link;
Netscape already has the URL available when you click on highlighted
text, press
an arrow button, or select a menu item. But sometimes you won't have an
automatic link and instead have only the text of the URL (perhaps from
a friend
or a newspaper article). Netscape gives you the opportunity to type in a
URL
directly into the <b>Location</b> text field (or the URL dialog box
produced by
the <b>Open Location...</b> menu item from the <b>File</b> menu). Using
the
URL, Netscape will bring you the specified page just as if you had
clicked on
an automatic link. 
<p>
Here's a sample URL: <b>http://home.mcom.com/home/welcome.html</b> 
<p>
Netscape uses the URL text to find a particular item, such as a page,
among all the computers connected to the Internet. Within the URL text
are
components that specify the protocol, server, and pathname of an item.
Notice that
the protocol is followed by a colon (<b>http:</b>), the server is
preceded
by two slashes (<b>//home.mcom.com</b>), and each segment of the
pathname is
preceded by a single slash (<b>/home/welcome.html</b>). 
<p>
The first component, the protocol, identifies a manner for interpreting
computer information. Many Internet pages use <b>HTTP</b> (short for
HyperText Transfer Protocol). Other common protocols you might come
across
include <b>file</b> (also known as ftp, short for File Transfer
Protocol),
<b>news</b> (the protocol used by Usenet news groups), and
<b>gopher</b> (an
alternative transfer protocol). 
<p>
The second component, the server, identifies the computer system that
stores the information you seek. Each server on the Internet has a
unique
address name whose text refers to the organization maintaining the
server.  
<p>
The last component, the pathname, identifies the location of an item on
the server. For example, a pathname might identify a page by specifying
the
name of the file comprising the page (such as <b>/welcome.html</b>) as
well as the
name of one or more folders that store a file (<b>/home</b>).<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>inding, starting and stopping
links</FONT>
</A>
<P>

A link is a connection from one page to another. You find a link by
looking for one or more words highlighted with color, underlining, or
both in the
content area of a page. Images and icons with colored borders also
serve as
links.
When the mouse cursor points over a link, the URL location of the link
appears
in the status field. 
<p>
You can bring a linked page to your screen by clicking once on the
highlighted text, image, or icon. Clicking on a link transfers page
content
from a server location to your location. After you click on a link,
the
Netscape status indicator animates to show you that the transfer of the
page to your
computer is in progress. You can stop a transfer in progress by
pressing
the
<b>Stop</b> button or choosing the <b>Stop Loading</b> menu item from
the
<b>Go</b>
menu.  
<p>
An unfollowed link is a connection to a page that you have not yet
viewed; a followed link is one you have. Unfollowed and followed links
are
highlighted in different colors. If you have a black and white monitor,
unfollowed and
followed links are highlighted only with underlining and thus not
differentiated. When your cursor points over a link, the status message
text field displays the URL of the page that one click will bring to
screen.
 
<p>
After you click on an unfollowed link, the link becomes a followed
link. If you go back to a page where you have clicked on a link, you'll
see that the
link has changed from the unfollowed color to the followed color. By
default, unfollowed links are blue and followed links are purple. (On a
Macintosh, you
can change
the colors used to denote unfollowed and followed links from the
<b>Styles</b> pop-up menu item in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box
from the
<b>Options</b> menu.)
<p>
You'll find the ability to stop a transfer in progress is useful if the

transfer is taking too long for your liking. This might happen if the 
content of the page is large or if the server computer is sluggish. 
Sometimes the page specified by a link  just isn't available. You'll
usually 
get a message if a connection was not
made or a page not found. Examine the status field and progress bar to
receive feedback about the progress of a transfer. 
<p>
Typically, a link brings a page to your screen where you see the whole
page.
However, if the information is extensive, you'll see only a portion of
a page. Usually the portion you see is the beginning of the page, but a
link
may bring you to anywhere in the middle or at the end. Also, a link
doesn't always
bring a new page to screen; rather, a link can bring a different
portion of
the same page
into the content area (in effect, automatically scrolling for you). For
example, the beginning of a page may include
a table of contents that links each chapter title to the chapter
subheading deeper into the page.

items</FONT>
</A>
<P>

In addition to highlighted text links, Netscape buttons and menu items
provide links to other pages. Many of the links controlled by buttons
and menu
items bring pages you have viewed at least once before. Button links
are
particularly useful for going back and forth among recently viewed
pages. Menu item links directly access a wider range of pages: Some
menu items show a history of pages you have viewed; others
serve
as bookmarks to bring pages that you (or others) have personally
selected
as noteworthy. 
<p>
Once you have brought a page to screen, you can view and store (using
Netscape or on paper) its URL. Every page is distinguished by its URL. 
Linking to a page via highlighted content, toolbar buttons, or menu 
items is a shortcut that enables you to bring the page without 
having to explicitly request the page's URL. When no built-in link is 
available,
you can bring a page by choosing <b>Open Location...</b> from the
<b>File</b>
menu, typing the URL in the dialog box, then pressing the <b>Open</b>
button. 
<p>
The toolbar offers the following button links:
<ul>
<li>	<b>Back</b> brings the previous page in the history list. The 
history list is a reference to pages you have viewed.
<li>	<b>Forward</b> brings the next page in the history list. 
(Available only after using the <b>Back</b> command or a history menu 
item.)
<li>	<b>Home</b> brings the home page designated in your
preferences.
<li>	<b>Open</b> produces a dialog box that allows you
to bring any page whose URL you can supply.</ul><p>
Menu items offer each of the links available through toolbar buttons 
plus many more. The Netscape 
application keeps track of pages you have seen, lets you create 
easy-access lists of favorite pages, and points you to pages with 
current information about Netscape and the Internet. Choosing a menu 
item that's the title of a page brings the page to screen.
<ul>
<li>	History items from the <b>Go</b> menu bring previously viewed
pages. The Netscape application automatically appends the title of a page
you
have viewed as the topmost menu item in the history list. Read about
the
<b>View History...</b> menu item to see how the history lineage is
maintained.
<li>	Bookmark items from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu bring pages of
your choice. You can add a bookmark menu item for the page you are
viewing
by choosing <b>Add Bookmark</b> from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu. Read
about
the <b>View Bookmarks...</b> menu item to learn how to establish lists
of
bookmarks for yourself and to share with others.
<li>	Items from the <b>Directory</b> and <b>Help</b> menus bring
up-to-date, reference pages for learning about Netscape software, 
communicating with Mosaic Communications Corporation, and exploring the
Internet.</ul>

<P>

You can tailor the look of the Netscape application by choosing to show
or hide certain graphical elements on the screen. You'll find the basic
alternatives
listed as items in the <b>Options</b> menu.
<p>
The default settings show the toolbar, location field, and directory
buttons. 
These graphical elements provide you with simplified access to links ,
commands, 
and page location information. By hiding any or all of these graphical 
elements, you increase the amount of screen real estate available for 
page content.
<ul>
<li>	Checking the <b>Show Toolbar</b> item displays a row of easily
accessible buttons that substitute for widely used menu items.
<li>	Checking the <b>Show Location</b> item displays
<b>Location:</b> and <b>Go to:</b> information that's useful
for tracking a page's
whereabouts or requesting a new page.
<li>	Checking the <b>Show Directory Buttons</b> item displays
a row of handy buttons that substitute for some <b>Directory</b> and 
<b>Help</b> menu items.
</ul><p>

Other items in the Options menu, <b>Show FTP File Information</b> and
<b>Auto Load Images</b> do not display a standard graphical element,
nor
increase the size of the content area. These items properly align
information
received in FTP format and automatically include inline graphics,
respectively. 
<p>
Choosing the <b>Preferences</b> item produces a dialog box with submenu
items for <b>Styles</b>; <b>Directories, Applications, and News</b>;
<b>Network and Images</b> (<b>Images, Network, and Mail</b> on the
Macintosh); 
<b>Mail and Proxies</b> (<b>Proxies</b> on the Macintosh); and
<b>Helper
Applications</b>. The <b>Styles</b> item provides additional
alternatives affecting the
display of text and links. The other items contain important settings
that enhance
the operations of the Netscape application.

To see your options regarding the look of Netscape windows and links:
<ol>
<li>	Choose <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
<li>	Examine the <b>Styles</b> item from the pop-up menu in
the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.</ol><p>
A set of radio buttons lets you change the font size in the content
area to <b>Small</b>, <b>Medium</b>, or <b>Large</b>. Another set of
radio
buttons lets you display the toolbar with <b>Pictures</b>, <b>Text</b>,
or
<b>Pictures and text</b>.  
<p>
A check box lets you specify if colored links should also be
underlined. With a black and white display, you must check this box to
underline links in
order for links to be visible. 
<p>
(On a Macintosh, a check box lets you select colors for unfollowed and
followed
links. Click in each of the colored boxes to produce a color wheel for
selecting the colors of your choice for unfollowed and followed links.
If the check
box is unchecked, the default color blue represents unfollowed links
and the
color purple represents followed links.)
<p>
Another set of radio buttons lets you designate the number of days
before the color of a followed link reverts back to the color of a
unfollowed
link. For example, if you specify 7 days, a link that you use to view a
page is
colored by the followed link color for 7 days, then changes back to the
unfollowed color. That is, the color indicator for followed a link
expires after 7
days. If you choose the <b>Never</b> radio button, followed links do
not
revert to the unfollowed color regardless of time. Pressing the
<b>Now</b> button
causes all followed links to revert to the color of unfollowed links
immediately. The default value specifies that followed links expire
after 30 days.

</A>
<P>

You can designate your own home page (the page the Netscape application
first brings to the screen each time you open a new window) by
supplying
a URL
as a preference item. The home page designated initially with Netscape
software (the default) has the URL: 
<p>
<b>http://home.mcom.com/home/home.html</b> 
<p>
You can change your home page (and change back to the default, if you
wish) in the following way:
<ol>
<li>	Choose <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
<li>	Examine the <b>Styles</b> submenu item from the pop-up menu in
the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.
<li>	Click the radio button <b>Home page URL:</b>.
<li>	Type in the URL of the page you wish to be your home
page. (Alternatively, you can check the radio button <b>Blank page</b>
if you
want the home page to be empty of content.)</ol>
<p>
Each time you ask the Netscape application to open a new window, the
designated home page is brought to screen. The URL can designate a page
from a
remote computer or one on your hard disk. 
<p>
To get the URL of a page on your hard disk, choose <b>Open File...</b>
from the <b>File</b> menu. Then select the page (file) on your hard
disk. After
the page opens, you'll see its URL in the <b>Location:</b> text field.
You can
select and copy the URL, then paste it into the <b>Home Page URL:
</b>text
field in your preferences. 
<p>
At first, you probably won't have any pages stored on your hard disk.
But later, you might want quick and sure access to certain pages such
as
one with valuable links or one you've created for yourself.

<FONT SIZE=+3>V</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>iewing inline images</FONT>
</A>
<P>

Ideally, pages on the screen should present images (or other multimedia
effects) as simply and efficiently as text. However, images (and sounds
and movies) are relatively larger in byte size than text and can take
considerable time to transport from remote computers (servers) to your
computer. The
length of time needed to bring a page with images depends on several
factors,
most prominently the speed of the modem or direct link connecting you
with a
remote server. To compensate for the potential lethargy of transmitting
images, Netscape software offers features that let you manipulate how
images are
handled. 
<p>
The Netscape application loads images into pages automatically. If the
author of a page has designed the page with images among the text (that

is, inline), the images are
displayed when you bring the page to your screen. You have the option,
however, of turning off the automatic loading of images. You can do
this by
unchecking the <b>Auto Load Images</b> item in the <b>Options</b> menu.
When this
menu item is unchecked, the images in pages do not automatically load.
Instead, small icons are placed in the position on the page where an
image would
otherwise be. You can then decide to view these images
at a later time.  To manually load all images that are represented by
icons, 
you can press the <b>Images</b> button in the toolbar or select
the <b>Load 
Images</b> menu item from the <b>View</b> menu.
<p>
The advantage of unchecking <b>Auto Load Images</b> is
that
pages are brought to screen faster. The disadvantage is that you can't
view
the images until you specify that you want the images loaded. 
<p>
The <b>Auto Load Images</b> item affects subsequent links and not the
current contents of a page. However, if you choose the <b>Reload</b>
item from
the <b>View</b> menu or press the <b>Reload</b> button on the toolbar,
you
bring the current page back again, this time with the <b>Auto Load
Image</b>
option active. 
<p>
You also have the
option of displaying an image incrementally as the image is transmitted
or 
in a single burst after the transmission. Typically, the <b>While
Loading</b> option 
provides more satisfying feedback. However, on a fast network, the
<b>After 
Loading</b> option may complete the load slightly faster. To set this
option:
<ol>
<li>	Choose <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
<li>	Choose the <b>Network and Images</b> submenu item (<b>Images, 
Network, and Mail</b> on the Macintosh) from the
pop-up menu in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.
<li>	Select one of the two radio buttons: <b>While Loading</b>
or <b>After Loading</b>.</ol>
<p>
Like highlighted text, an inline image may be linked to another page,
another position on the same page, or any type of external file such as
an
external image. As with all links, pointing the mouse button over a
link puts in
the URL location of the prospective link in the status field. 
<p>

<HR ALIGN="right"WIDTH=85%>
<A NAME="RTFToC10">
<FONT SIZE=+3>V</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>iewing external images</FONT>
</A>
<P>

External images (unlike inline images) are displayed in their own
windows. You can view an external image by clicking on a link to the
image. The
Netscape application can open external images stored in <b>gif</b> and
<b>jpeg</b> file formats; other file formats require that you have a
suitable helper
applications available on your hard disk (and referenced in the
<b>Preferences</b> 
dialog box of the <b>Options</b> menu). 
<p>
Links to external images work like links to pages. An external image
file has a unique URL just like an ordinary page. You can click on
highlighted
text, an image icon, or an inline image to bring an external image into
a
separate window on the screen. Netscape or the external application opens
and
presents the image in a separate window. You must click back into the
Netscape window
to continue working with the Netscape application. 
<p>
External images are not automatically loaded in their full
representation even if the <b>Auto Load Images</b> item is checked.
However, pages that
wish to present very large or detailed images often have inline
snapshot images
(also called thumbnail images) inserted into pages that serve as links
to
external images. Unlike the icon replacements, these snapshots provide
an
approximate view of the actual image, yet are still much smaller and
faster to
transport than the full image. You can expand the snapshot into the
full image by
clicking once on the snapshot.

Do you know the name of your news server and e-mail server? If not, you
will have to find out from your service provider, systems
administrator, or
resident know-it-all. By specifying the names of these servers as
preference
items, Netscape software can provide you with news reader features and
the
ability to send e-mail. 
<p>
World Wide Web pages provide one means of obtaining information on the
Internet. Two other popular Internet information services are Usenet
newsgroups and electronic mail (e-mail). The Netscape application lets
you fully
interact with Usenet newsgroups. You can also send e-mail with the text
of a
page included. Upcoming pages describe these services in more detail. 
<p>
Before you can access any newsgroup news or send any e-mail, you need
to tell the Netscape application how to make the appropriate connection
to the
server computer handling each task. Whereas World Wide Web pages are
distributed by servers familiar with World Wide Web protocols, Usenet
newsgroups and
e-mail use their own protocols. 
<p>
Newsgroup news is distributed by a news server. To specify the name of
your news server:
<ol>
<li>	Choose <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
<li>	Choose the <b>Directories, Applications, and News</b> submenu
item from the pop-up menu in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.
<li>	Type in the name of the news server in the <b>News (NNTP)
Server</b> field (ideally, a local news server if available).</ol>

server. To specify the name of your SMTP server:
<ol>
<li>	Choose <b>Preferences</b> from the <b>Options</b> menu.
<li>	Choose the <b>Mail and Proxies</b> submenu item (<b>Images,

You can access a Usenet newsgroup posting in much the same way as you
access an ordinary page. Clicking on a link to a Usenet newsgroup (or
choosing
<b>Open
Location...</b> from the <b>File</b> menu and entering the URL of the
newsgroup) brings you the newsgroup directory. A newsgroup directory
lists the titles of the postings. After you see the newsgroup directory
in the
content area of the Netscape window, click on the title (highlighted like
other
Netscape links) to bring the posting to screen. 
<p>
A posting is a piece of writing (or news, for short) made available for
others on the Internet to read. To help organize the subject material
of
postings, people post (send their news) to newsgroups rather than the
Internet as
a whole. Each newsgroup has a name intended to reflect the topic of
discussion for its postings. The Usenet is the collection of all
newsgroups; it is
the bulletin board of the Internet especially designed for people to
communicate news with one another on special interest topics. 
<p>
Netscape software lets you read, write, and send newsgroup postings.
Netscape gives you the opportunity to bring a newsgroup directory and any
of its
postings to your screen by supplying the appropriate URL. Once you are
viewing a
posting, Netscape provides a set of buttons on screen that allow you to
initiate
or reply to a posting. 
<p>
For example, the URL <b>news:alt.music</b> specifies the server
protocol <b>news:</b> and the newsgroup <b>alt.music</b>. Unlike other
Internet
connections, the URL does not specify a server name and pathname with
preceding slashes. Each newsgroup has a unique name, described with
words
separated by periods, and uses its own directory for locating postings.
You can use
the the asterisk character (<b>*</b>) as a wildcard substitute to match
all
listings. For example, the URL <b>news.alt.*</b> brings you a directory
of all
the newsgroups beginning with the characters <b>alt</b>. You can use
this

newsgroups
among the many types of newsgroups:

<b>news.alt.music*</b><p>

The Netscape application lets you create and send outgoing
e-mail. (Currently, Netscape has no facility for receiving incoming
e-mail so
you'll need a dedicated mail application to read e-mail sent to you.)
With the
press of a button, you can insert the text of the current page in the
e-mail
message you create. You can also send a page attached as a text or HTML
file. Only
the text or HTML text (and not the images, sounds, or other non-ASCII
data) of a
page can be transmitted. 
<p>
To use Netscape's e-mail capability, choose <b>Mail Document</b> in the
<b>File</b> menu to produce the <b>Mail</b> dialog box. The dialog has
three text fields for you to enter information:<p>

<ul>
<li>	The <b>To:</b> field requires the e-mail address of the
intended recipient.
<li>	The <b>Subject:</b> field offers a place to include a
short description of the e-mail.
<li>	The large message field offers a place to type a message
and include the text of the current page.</ul><p>
You need to know the Internet mail address of where you want your
e-mail to go. Internet addresses typically contain a user name followed
by the @
symbol (pronounced "at"), followed by mail server location name. For
example,
to send e-mail to Mosaic Communications Corporation, enter:<p>
<p>
<b>info@mcom.com</b> 
<p>
Pressing the <b>Include Document Text</b> button inserts the text of
the current page inside the message field. Each line of included text
appears in the message field preceded by the greater than symbol
(<b>&gt;</b>).
The Netscape application automatically inserts the <b>&gt;</b> symbol to
differentiate the page's text from your message. 
<p>
You can also choose to send the e-mail with an attachment of the text
of the current page. An attachment is a separate document (file) sent
along
with the e-mail message. The <b>Attach:</b> pop-up menu offers the
choice of
<b>No attachment</b>, <b>Text</b>, or <b>HTML</b>. If you want to send
the
current page as an attachment (this may be helpful if your recipient is
going
to reuse the document), choosing the <b>Text</b> item sends the text of
the
message intact (no <b>&gt;</b> symbols are appended to each line) while
choosing the <b>HTML</b> item sends the text of the message embedded
with all the
HTML instructions that format Internet pages.

In addition to viewing pages, Netscape software gives you the opportunity
save a page as a file on your computer. You can do this after or
instead of
bringing the page to your screen. 
<p>
The <b>Save As...</b> item from the <b>File</b> menu produces a dialog
box that lets you save the current page as either a text file or an
HTML file on
your disk. 
<p>
On Windows, clicking on a link with the shift key held 
down produces a dialog box that lets you save the requested page as 
a disk file instead of bringing the page to screen. The feature is 
particularly useful for retrieving a nonformatted page (such as a 
data file) not intended for viewing. 
<p>
A similar feature is offered as a menu item on the Macintosh: The 
<b>Save Next Link as...</b> item from the <b>File</b> menu saves to
disk (instead of bringing to screen) the page whose link you next click
on. 
The cursor changes shape to remind you that your next click on a link 
saves the requested page or data as a file (in HTML source format) on 
your disk instead of displaying the page. The menu command 
affects only one link. If you click anywhere other than on a link in 
the content area, the menu command is canceled and the 
cursor returns to its original shape.
<p>
The <b>Source...</b> item from the <b>View</b> menu produces a dialog
box that lets you view the current page in its HTML format. Pressing
the <b>Save
Document</b> button in the dialog box saves the HTML formatted window
as a file (like the <b>Save As...</b> menu item). 
<p>
The <b>Mail Document </b>item from the <b>File</b> menu produces a
dialog box that lets you send the current page as an e-mail attachment.

<p>
The <b>View Bookmarks </b>item from the <b>Bookmarks</b> menu produces
a dialog box that offers an <b>Export...</b> button. This button does
not save
pages, but lets you save page links in a file. 
<p>
Note: Netscape software works on several computer platforms and reserves
the use of a few special characters to help interpret URLs. To avoid
problems,
you should not use the following characters as part of a file name:<p>

<ul>
<li>	the slash (/)
<li>	the colon (:)
<li>	the number symbol (#)</ul>

Many of the File and Edit menu items in the Netscape application work as 
they do on other applications. You can copy from and print the
content
area of pages, though you might need to adjust the size of the Netscape
window to
have a page print in the way you wish. 
<p>
To open a new Netscape window, choose <b>New Window</b> from the
<b>File</b> menu. The new window brings another copy of your home page
to screen in
a fully functional and independent Netscape window. You can have
simultaneous
network connections. 
<p>
To print the contents of the current page, choose <b>Print...</b> from
the <b>File</b> menu or press the <b>Print</b> button (not on Windows)
in 
the toolbar. A <b>Print</b> dialog box lets you select printing options

and begin printing. 
<p>
The Netscape application prints a page in the same width as the page
appears on screen. The print command does not rearrange the content
area (text is
not word-wrapped and graphics are not repositioned) in order to
accommodate
paper size. If the material in the content area extends beyond the
right-hand
edge of a single page, another page prints containing the continuation.
To make
pages print without horizontal breaks (or simply to realign pages to
your
liking), you can narrow the Netscape window so that the width of the
content area
on the screen matches the width of your paper. You can press the Netscape
window's zoom box to resize the screen to its default size. 
<p>
To set up the page for printing, choose <b>Print Setup...</b> (or
<b>Page Setup...</b> on the Macintosh) from the <b>File</b> menu. You
can use
this command to choose landscape printing (across the long side of
paper)
instead of the more common portrait orientation. 
<p>
To cut, copy, and paste, choose the respective items from the
<b>Edit</b> menu. Note that <b>Cut</b> and <b>Paste</b> items are only
effective in
certain editable fields. The content area is a read-only field that
only
enables you to select and copy text for use elsewhere. 
<p>
To find a word or phrase within a page, choose <b>Find...</b> from the
<b>Edit</b> menu or press the <b>Find</b> button in the toolbar. A
<b>Find</b> dialog box lets you enter the string of characters that you
wish to find. Check the <b>Case Sensitive</b> radio button to require
capital 
letters to match. Check the <b>Find Backwards</b> radio button to
search from 
the insertion bar toward the beginning of the document (rather than 
toward the end). A search that reaches one end of the document produces

a dialog box asking whether you wish to continue the search from the 
opposite end. A
search that reaches one end of the document produces a dialog box
asking
whether you wish to continue the search from the opposite end. 
<P>
To find the same word or phrase again, choose <b>Find Again</b> from
the <B>Edit</B> menu.
