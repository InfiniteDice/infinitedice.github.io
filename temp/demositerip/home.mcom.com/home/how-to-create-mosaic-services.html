So you've been wandering the web for a while now, and you're ready to
start contributing to the great flow of information on the Internet. Where
do you start? How do you begin? Providing information on the World
Wide Web has two parts: writing the World Wide Web documents and
finding a World Wide Web server (such as Netsite) that will
distribute them.

In order to write WWW documents, you'll need to learn how to use HTML,
the HyperText Markup Language that defines how a World Wide Web document
looks. You can get a glimpse of HTML by choosing <I>Source</I> from
the <I>View</I> menu. There are a number of places where you can learn
about HTML.

HTML</A>

supports, you can read about them, too.

Once you've written your HTML, you'll also want to learn about more
advanced topics like forms, GIF, JPEG images, and a host of other
topics every World Wide Web author should know. Check out:

editors</A> 
<DD>If using a plain text editor and writing in HTML is too awful for
you, there are a number of HTML editors on Mac,
Windows, and X. Some use programs like Emacs, Microsoft Word,
and Frame Maker to generate HTML. Others stand on their own as HTML
editors. This site will help you find them.
