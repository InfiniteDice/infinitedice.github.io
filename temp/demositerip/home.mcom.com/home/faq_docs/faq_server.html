<DT><B><A NAME=s1>What  is Netsite server software?</A></B>
<P>
<DD>Netsite is the first commercial Internet server software that
is compatible with the NCSA httpd server.  Netsite software
allows organizations to "serve" or post information, including formatted 
text, graphical images, audio and video, and to conduct transactions on the
Internet and other global networks based on the Internet Protocol
(IP). 
<P>
The Netsite product line includes two products available for UNIX-based
platforms:
<UL>
<LI>Netsite Communications Server
<LI>Netsite Commerce Server
</UL><P>
The Netsite Communications Server is designed for applications that 
don't require the advanced  security features contained  in the Netsite Commerce Server, such as the delivery of online marketing materials and customer support 
information to customers, and communications  to employees.
<P>
The Netsite Commerce Server makes electronic commerce a reality allowing transactions and the exchange of sensitive data on the Internet.
The Netsite Commerce Server provides bulletproof  security based on public-key cryptographic technology from RSA Data Security, Inc.
<P>
Bulletproof security includes data encryption to ensure the privacy of client/server communications, and server authentication, which uses certification  and a digital signature to verify the legitimacy of the server.
<P>

interactive,  media-rich environment for applications such as 
marketing, corporate communications,
